# React Native Mobile Flashcard App

## Introduction

This is an interactive app that allows the user to study with flashcards and create their own decks and flashcards.
This app runs on *Android* devices and emulators. 

I created this app to learn more about React Native and to help
people study more efficiently. This app is highly customizable and
can be used for any academic subject. It also will help users build
consistent study habits by sending out a daily notification if the 
user hasn't studied that day. 

## How to Install and Run

This project is very easy to install and run. Just clone the 
Github repository, run `yarn install` from a terminal in the main 
folder, and then run `yarn start`. If you're using expo, run 
`expo start`. This will start the app on the local server and 
show a QR code that can be scanned with the Expo App to open the app
on an Android device.
