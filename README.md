# React Native Mobile Flashcard App

## Introduction

    This is an interactive app that allows the user to study with flashcards and create their own decks and flashcards.
    This app runs on Android devices and emulators. 

    I created this app to learn more about React Native and to help
    people study more efficiently. This app is highly customizable and
    can be used for any academic subject. It also will help users build
    consistent study habits by sending out a daily notification if the 
    user hasn't studied that day. 

## How to Install and Run

    This project is very easy to install and run. Just run clone the 
    Github repository, run `yarn install` from a terminal in the main 
    folder, and then run `yarn start`. If you're using expo, run 
    `expo start` and open the Expo app on the (Android) device.
